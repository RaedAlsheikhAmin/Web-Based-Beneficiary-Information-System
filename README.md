# Watan-Internship
 Watan Organization provides critical support to vulnerable populations through  various programs and services. However, the organization faced significant  challenges in managing beneficiary data and tracking assistance records effectively.  Previously, data management processes were largely manual, making it difficult to  maintain accurate records, ensure data security, and provide quick access to  beneficiary information. This approach was not only time-consuming but also prone  to human error, creating inefficiencies that impacted the organization’s ability to  deliver timely and targeted support.  Furthermore, Watan Organization required a secure, centralized system that would  allow different user roles—such as administrators, staff, and volunteers—to access  and manage data according to their responsibilities. Without a structured, role based system, it was challenging to safeguard sensitive information while allowing  necessary access to those actively engaged in aid distribution.  The absence of an automated Beneficiary Information System hindered the  organization’s efficiency in tracking services provided to individuals, analyzing  needs, and coordinating volunteer efforts. To address these challenges, a solution  was needed to automate data management, enhance data security, and support  seamless access to beneficiary information across user roles.
